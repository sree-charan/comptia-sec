Zero-knowledge proofs satisfy three properties: completeness (a true statement can be proven), soundness (a false statement cannot be proven), and zero-knowledge (the verifier learns nothing about the information itself). This enables verification without exposure of sensitive data.",

    "correctOption": "To provide a hardware root of trust for storing encryption keys securely",
    "explanation": "The primary purpose of using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for disk encryption is to provide a hardware root of trust for securely storing encryption keys. The TPM is a specialized chip designed to securely store cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations in hardware, preventing software-based attacks from extracting the keys. For disk encryption, the TPM can securely hold the disk encryption key and release it only when the system boot integrity is verified, significantly enhancing security.",

      "Peak event ingestion rates",
      "Total storage capacity",
      "Number of connected devices"
    ],
    "correctOption": "Peak event ingestion rates",
    "explanation": "Peak event ingestion rates are most useful for capacity planning security monitoring systems because they reveal the maximum load the system must handle. Security events often spike during incidents or attacks, and monitoring systems must process these peak loads without dropping events. Planning for these peaks ensures the system remains effective during critical security situations.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [
      "Average utilization doesn't account for critical peak periods",

      "Maximizing capacity at the lowest cost location"
    ],
    "correctOption": "Distributing capacity across multiple diverse locations",
    "explanation": "Distributing capacity across multiple diverse locations best supports geographic resilience by ensuring that regional disasters won't disable all infrastructure. This approach creates redundancy in different geographic areas, allowing operations to continue from unaffected locations when one area experiences a disaster, whether natural, technical, or human-caused.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [
      "Consolidation creates a single point of failure vulnerable to local disasters",
      "Using a single provider still creates dependency on that provider's resilience",

      "Purchasing capacity for average load only",
      "Outsourcing all capacity planning to vendors"
    ],
    "correctOption": "Implementing elastic capacity with cloud bursting",
    "explanation": "Implementing elastic capacity with cloud bursting balances cost and resilience by maintaining baseline capacity on-premises while enabling automatic expansion to cloud resources during peak loads. This approach avoids overprovisioning for rare peak events while ensuring capacity is available when needed, optimizing costs while maintaining resilience.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [
      "Maximum peak plus 100% creates expensive excess capacity that rarely gets used",
      "Planning for average load only leaves systems vulnerable during peaks",

    "correctOption": "Implementing modular, scalable architecture",
    "explanation": "Implementing modular, scalable architecture best addresses rapid growth by allowing incremental expansion without major redesigns. This approach enables the organization to add capacity in smaller, more frequent increments as needed, keeping pace with actual growth rather than over-provisioning early or facing disruptive upgrades later.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

    "explanation": "A tabletop exercise involves team members discussing hypothetical scenarios to evaluate their response plans and decision-making processes. It's a low-cost, low-risk method where participants walk through their responsibilities and actions during simulated disruptions without actually activating systems or performing technical activities. It focuses on communication, coordination, and decision-making.",

      "Code review"
    ],
    "correctOption": "Full-scale simulation",
    "explanation": "A full-scale simulation would be most appropriate for validating a ransomware recovery plan because it includes actually performing the technical recovery steps in a controlled environment. This tests the entire process of detecting the attack, isolating systems, restoring from backups, and validating data integrity—all critical components that need to work under pressure during a real ransomware incident.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [
      "Checklist review doesn't validate technical capabilities, only completeness",

    "correctOption": "They identify gaps in plans and team knowledge",
    "explanation": "A key benefit of regular tabletop exercises is identifying gaps in plans and team knowledge without the risk of disrupting operations. These discussion-based exercises reveal ambiguities in procedures, confusion about responsibilities, missing steps in plans, and knowledge gaps among team members, allowing these issues to be addressed before a real incident occurs.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

    "correctOption": "Both technical and human performance factors",
    "explanation": "Recovery test debriefs should evaluate both technical and human performance factors for a comprehensive assessment. Technical factors include system performance, tool effectiveness, and procedural accuracy, while human factors include communication effectiveness, decision quality, stress management, and coordination. Both aspects are crucial for successful recovery during real incidents.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

    ],
    "correctOption": "Untested plans may fail when needed",
    "explanation": "The greatest risk of not conducting recovery testing is that untested plans may fail when actually needed during a real disaster. Without testing, organizations can't identify flaws in their recovery procedures, discover missing dependencies, recognize performance bottlenecks, or ensure team members know their responsibilities—all potentially leading to failed recovery when it matters most.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [
      "While possible, premium increases are a secondary concern to recovery failure",

    "correctOption": "Parallel testing",
    "explanation": "Parallel testing offers the best balance between thoroughness and minimizing disruption because it tests actual recovery systems with real workloads without interrupting production operations. By running recovery systems alongside production and verifying they can handle the load, organizations gain confidence in their technical recovery capabilities without the risk of business disruption.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

      "Only when required by auditors"
    ],
    "correctOption": "At least annually and after significant changes",
    "explanation": "Critical system recovery capabilities should be tested at least annually and after significant changes to ensure ongoing effectiveness. Regular testing verifies that procedures remain valid despite environmental changes, while testing after significant changes ensures those changes haven't broken recovery capabilities. This frequency balances thoroughness with practical resource constraints.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

If an organization's RPO is 4 hours, backups must occur at least every 4 hours to ensure no more than 4 hours of data is lost. The RPO represents the business's tolerance for data loss and directly dictates how often backups must run.",

    "correctOption": "Cloud backups with versioning and immutability",
    "explanation": "Cloud backups with versioning and immutability provide the best protection against ransomware because they cannot be modified or deleted once created, even by administrators. This prevents ransomware from encrypting or corrupting backups, ensures multiple versions are preserved, and typically stores data offsite, allowing recovery even if local systems are completely compromised.",

    ],
    "correctOption": "Protection from site-wide disasters",
    "explanation": "The primary advantage of storing backup media offsite is protection from site-wide disasters such as fires, floods, or structural failures. Offsite storage ensures that a catastrophic event affecting the primary location won't also destroy the backups, allowing for recovery even when the original site is completely compromised or inaccessible.",
    "incorrectExplanations": [

    "correctOption": "It protects data if physical media is lost or stolen",
    "explanation": "Encryption is particularly important for offsite backups because it protects data if physical media is lost or stolen during transport or while stored at the offsite location. Since offsite backups physically leave organizational control, encryption ensures the data remains protected from unauthorized access even if the physical media is compromised.",

    "correctOption": "3 total copies, on 2 different media types, with 1 copy offsite",
    "explanation": "The 3-2-1 backup rule specifies maintaining 3 total copies of data (original plus two backups), stored on 2 different media types (e.g., disk and tape, or disk and cloud), with 1 copy stored offsite. This strategy provides redundancy against different failure scenarios, including media failures and site-wide disasters.",
